## Tools and Knowledge

I won't tell you which operating system you should use - there is an interesting discussion on
[hackernews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3786674 "hackernews"). I'll leave it free for the reader of this book
which to use, because basically you are reading this book to learn Padrino.


To actually see a running padrino app, you need a web browser of your choice.  For writing the application, you can
either use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or with a plain text editor.


Nowadays there are a bunch of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) out there:


- [RubyMine by JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/ "RubyMine") - commercial, available for all platforms
- [Aptana RadRails](http://www.aptana.com/products/radrails "Aptana RadRails") - free, available for all platforms


Here is a list of plain text editors which are a popular choice among Ruby developers:


- [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/ "Emacs") - free, available for all platforms.
- [Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/ "Gedit") - free, available for Linux and Windows.
- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ "Notepad ++") - free, available only for Windows.
- [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com "SublimeText") - commercial, available for all platforms.
- [Textmate](http://macromates.com/ "Textmate") - commercial, available only for Mac.
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim") - free, available for all platforms.


All tools have their strengths and weaknesses. Try to find the software that works best for you. The main goal is that
you comfortable because you will spend a lot of time with it.


**Ruby Knowledge**

For any non-Ruby people, I strongly advise you to check out one of these books and learn the basics of Ruby before
continuing here.


- [Programming Ruby](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9 "Programming Ruby") - the
  standard book on Ruby.
- [Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://www.scribd.com/doc/8545174/Whys-Poignant-Guide-to-Ruby "Poignant Guide To Ruby") -
  written by the nebulous programmer [why the lucky stiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff "Stiff") in
  an entertaining and educational way.


In this book, I assume readers having Ruby knowledge and will not be explaining every last detail. I will, however,
explain Padrino-specific coding techniques and how to get most parts under test.
