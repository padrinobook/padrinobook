# Job Vacancy Application

There are more IT jobs out there than there are skilled people available. It would be great if we could have the possibility to offer a platform where users can easily post new jobs vacancies to recruit people for their company.  Now our job is to build this software using Padrino. We will apply [**K.I.S.S**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle "KISS principle") principle to obtain a simple and extensible design.


First, we are going to create the app file and folder structure. Then we are adding feature by feature until the app is complete. First, we will take a look at the basic design of our app. Afterwards, we will implement one feature at a time.
