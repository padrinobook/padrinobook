## Creating The Application

Start with generating a new project with the canonical `padrino` command. In contrast to our "Hello World!" application (app) before, we are using new options:


```sh
$ mkdir ~/padrino-projects
$ cd ~/padrino-projects
$ padrino-gen project job-vacancy -d activerecord \
  -t rspec \
  -s jquery \
  -e erb \
  -a sqlite
```


Explanation of the fields commands:


- **-d activerecord**: We are using [Active Record](https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord "Active Record") as the orm library (*Object Relational Mapper*).
- **-t rspec**: We are using the [RSpec](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/get-in-touch "RSpec") testing framework.
- **-s jquery**: Defining the JavaScript library we are using - for this app will be using the ubiquitous [jQuery](https://jquery.com "jQuery") library.
- **-e erb**: We are using [ERB](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.1/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html "ERB") (*embedded ruby*) markup for writing HTML templates.
- **-a sqlite**: Our adapter for the activerecord ORM[^orm] database adapter is [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org "SQLite"). The whole database is saved in a text file.


Since we are using RSpec for testing, we will use its' built-in mock extensions [rspec-mocks](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks "rspec mocks") for writing tests later. In case you want to use another mocking library like [rr](https://rubygems.org/gems/rr "rr") or [mocha](http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs "mocha"), feel free to add it with the **-m** option.


You can use a vast array of other options when generating your new Padrino app, this table shows the currently available options:

The command line alias is `-c`.
- `mock`: Available options are: [mocha](http://gofreerange.com/mocha "mocha") and [rr](http://rr.github.io/rr "rr").


The default value of each option is none. In order to use them you have to specify the option you want to use.


Besides the `project` option for generating new Padrino apps, the following table illustrates the other generators available:


- `admin`: A  built-in admin dashboard to manager your entities.
- `admin_page`: Creates for an existing model the CRUD operation for the admin interface.
- `app`: You can define other apps to be mounted in your main app.
- `controller`: A controller takes data from the models and puts them into view that are rendered.
- `mailer`: Creating new mailers within your app.
- `migration`: Migrations simplify changing the database schema.
- `model`: Models describe data objects of your application.
- `project`: Generates a completely new app from the scratch.
- `plugin`: Creating new Padrino projects based on a template file - it's like a list of commands.


Later, when *the time comes*, we will add extra gems, for now though we'll grab the current gems using `bundle`[^bundle] by running at the command line:


```sh
$ bundle install
```

[^bundle]: You can also use the `-b` option during project creation - then bundle will run for your automatically.


### Basic Layout

Lets design our first version of the *index.html* page which is the starter page our app. An early design question is: Where to put the *index.html* page? Because we are not working with controllers, the easiest thing is to put the *index.html* directly under the public folder in the project.


We are using [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5 "HTML5") for the page, and add the following code into `public/index.html`:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <title>Start Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello, Padrino!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```


Plain static content - this used to be the way websites were created in the beginning of the web. Today, apps provide dynamic layout. During this chapter, we will how to add more and more dynamic parts to our app.


We can take a look at our new page by executing the following command:


```sh
$ cd job-vacancy
$ bundle exec padrino start
```


You should see a message telling you that Padrino has taken the stage, and you should be able to view our created index page by visiting <http://localhost:3000/index.html> in your browser.


You might ask "Why do we use the `bundle exec` command - isn't `padrino start` enough?" The reason for this is that we use bundler to load exactly those Ruby gems that we specified in the Gemfile. I recommend that you use `bundle exec` for all following commands, but to focus on Padrino, I will skip this command on the following parts of the book.


You may have thought it a little odd that we had to manually requests the index.html in the URL when viewing our start page. This is because our app currently has no idea about **routing**. Routing is the process to recognize request URLs and to forward these requests to actions of controllers. With other words: A router is like a like vending machine where you put in money to get a coke. In this case, the machine is the *router* which *routes* your input "Want a coke" to the action "Drop a Coke in the tray".


### First Controller And Routing

Lets add some basic routes for displaying our home, about, and contact-page. How can we do this? With the help of a routing controller. A controller makes data from you app (in our case job offers) available to the view (seeing the details of a job offer). Now let's create a controller in Padrino names page:


```sh
$ padrino-gen controller pages --no-helper
  create  app/controllers/pages.rb
  create  app/views/pages
   apply  tests/rspec
  create  spec/app/controllers/pages_controller_spec.rb
```


Please note that we are using the `--no-helper` option which omits the creation of a helper files for our views.


Lets take a closer look at our page-controller:


```ruby
# app/controller/pages.rb

JobVacancy::App.controllers :pages do

  # get :index, :map => '/foo/bar' do
  #   session[:foo] = 'bar'
  #   render 'index'
  # end

  # get :sample, :map => '/sample/url', :provides => [:any, :js] do
  #   case content_type
  #     when :js then ...
  #     else ...
  # end

  # get :foo, :with => :id do
  #   'Maps to url '/foo/#{params[:id]}''
  # end

  # get '/example' do
  #   'Hello world!'
  # end
end
```


The controller above defines for our `JobVacancy` the `:pages` controller with no specified routes inside the app. Let's change this and define the *about*, *contact*, and *home* actions:


```ruby
# app/controller/pages.rb

JobVacancy:.App.controllers :pages do
  get :about, :map => '/about' do
    render :erb, 'about'
  end

  get :contact , :map => '/contact' do
    render :erb, 'contact'
  end

  get :home, :map => '/' do
    render :erb, 'home'
  end
end
```


We will go through each line:


- `JobVacancy::App.controller :pages` - defines the namespace *page* for our JobVacancy app. Typically, the controller name will also be part of the route.
- `do ... end` - This expression defines a block in Ruby. Think of it as a method without a name, also called anonymous functions, which is passed to another function as an argument.
- `get :about, :map => '/about'` - The HTTP command *get* starts the declaration of the route followed by the *about* action (as a symbol[^symbol]), and is finally mapped to the explicit URL */about*. When you start your server with `bundle exec padrino s` and visit the URL <http://localhost:3000/about>, you can see the rendered output of this request.
- `render :erb, 'about'` - This action tells us that we want to render the *erb* file *about* for the corresponding controller which is `page` in our case. This file is actually located at `app/views/page/about.erb` file. Normally the views are placed under `app/views/<controller-name>/<action-name>.<ending>`. Instead of using an ERB templates, you could also use `:haml`, or another [template engine](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/template_engines "template engine for Ruby"). You can even completely drop the rendering option and leave the matching completely for Padrino.


[^symbol]: Unlike strings, symbols of the same name are initialized and exist in memory only once during a session of ruby. This makes your programs more efficient.


Call the following command to see all defined routes for your application:


```sh
$ padrino rake routes
=> Executing Rake routes ...

  Application: JobVacancy
  URL                  REQUEST  PATH
  (:pages, :about)        GET    /about
  (:pages, :contact)      GET    /contact
  (:pages, :home)         GET    /
```


### Application Template

Although we are now able to put content (albeit static) on our site, it would be nice to have some sort of basic styling on our web page. First we need to generate a basic template for all pages we want to create:


```erb
<%# app/views/layouts/application.erb %>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <title>Job Vacancy - find the best jobs</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```


Let's see what is going on with the `<%= yield %>` line. At first you may ask what does the `<>` symbols mean. They are indicators that you want to execute Ruby code to fetch data that is put into the template. Here, the `yield` command will put the content of the called page, like *about.erb* or *contact.erb*,  into the template.


### CSS Design Using bulma

[bulma](https://bulma.io/ "bulma") is an open source CSS framework based on Flexbox. It is designed to be 100%
responsive for mobile devices.

Padrino itself also provides built-in templates for common tasks done on web app. These [padrino-recipes](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-recipes "Padrino recipes") help you saving time by not reinventing the wheel. Thanks to [@wikimatze](https://twitter.com/wikimatze "@wikimatze"), we use his [bulma-plugin](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-recipes/blob/master/plugins/bulma_plugin.rb "bulma plugin") by executing:


```sh
$ padrino g plugin bulma
   apply  https://raw.github.com/padrino/padrino-recipes/master/ \
     plugins/bulma_plugin.rb
   create    public/stylesheets/bulma.css
```


Next we need to include the style sheet in our app template for the whole app:


```erb
<%# app/views/layouts/application.erb %>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <title>Job Vacancy - find the best jobs</title>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'bulma' %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'jquery', 'jquery-ujs' %>
  </head>
  <body>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```


The `stylesheet_link_tag` points to files in your app *public/stylesheets* directory and will automatically creates a link to the given stylesheets.
You can also use `javascript_include_tag` which does the same as `stylesheet_link_tag` just for JavaScript files.


### Navigation

Next we want to create the top-navigation for our app. We already implemented the *page* controller with the relevant actions. All we need is to put links to them in a navigation header for our basic layout.


```erb
<%# app/views/layouts/application.erb %>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <title>Job Vacancy - find the best jobs</title>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'bulma.css', 'site.css' %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'jquery.js', 'burger_navigation' %>
</head>
<body>
  <nav class="navbar">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="navbar-brand">
        <a class="navbar-item" href="/">Job Vacancy</a>
        <span class="navbar-burger burger" data-target="navbarMenu">
          <span></span>
          <span></span>
          <span></span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div id="navbarMenu" class="navbar-menu">
        <div class="navbar-end">
          <div class="tabs is-right">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <%= link_to 'Home', url(:pages, :home) %>
              </li>
              <li>
                <%= link_to 'About', url(:pages, :about) %>
              </li>
              <li>
                <%= link_to 'Contact', url(:pages, :contact) %>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </nav>
  <div class="container">
    <%= yield %>
  </div>
</body>
```


Explanation of the new parts:


- [link_to](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework/Padrino/Helpers/AssetTagHelpers#link_to-instance_method "link_to-instance_method") - Is a helper for creating links. The first argument is the name for the link and the second is for the URL (href) to which the link points to.
- [url](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework/Padrino/Routing/InstanceMethods#url-instance_method "url-instance_method") - This helper return the link which can be used as the second parameter for the `link_to` function. It specifies the <:controller>, <:action> which will be executed. You can use in your helper in your whole app to create clean and encapsulated URLs.


Now that the we provide links to other parts of the app, lets add some sugar-candy styling:


```css
/* public/stylesheets/site.css */
body {
  font: 18.5px Palatino, 'Palatino Linotype', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana,
    sans-serif;
  text-align: justify;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 200%;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}


/* Tab Navigation */
.tabs ul {
  border-bottom: none;
}
```


I will not explain anything at this point about CSS. If you still don't know how to use it, please go through [w3c school css](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp "w3c school css") tutorial. Since we are using the asset pipeline, we don't need to register our new CSS file in `views/application.erb` - now you will understand why we did this.


Since [bulma is designed to be full responsive](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/responsiveness/ "bulma is designed to be full responsive") we want to have our navigation also available on mobile devices. For that reason we will add the following JavaScript code:


```javascript
// public/javascripts/burger_navigation.js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
  // Get all "navbar-burger" elements
  var $navbarBurgers = Array.prototype.slice.\
    call(document.querySelectorAll('.navbar-burger'), 0);

  // Check if there are any navbar burgers
  if ($navbarBurgers.length > 0) {

    // Add a click event on each of them
    $navbarBurgers.forEach(function ($el) {
      $el.addEventListener('click', function () {

        // Get the target from the "data-target" attribute
        var target = $el.dataset.target;
        var $target = document.getElementById(target);

        // Toggle the class on both the "navbar-burger" and the "navbar-menu"
        $el.classList.toggle('is-active');
        $target.classList.toggle('is-active');
      });
    });
  }
});
```


### Writing Tests

Our site does not list static entries of job offers that you write, but other users will be allowed to post job offers from the Internet to our site. We need to add this behavior to our site. To be on the sure side, we will implement this behavior by writing tests first, then the code. We use the [RSpec](http://rspec.info/ "RSpec") testing framework for this.


Remember when we created the *page-controller* with `padrino-gen controller page`? Thereby, Padrino created a corresponding spec file `spec/app/controller/page_controller_spec.rb` which has the following content:


```ruby
# spec/app/controller/page_controller_spec.rb
require 'spec_helper'

RSpec.describe "/page" do
  pending "add some examples to #{__FILE__}" do
    before do
      get "/page"
    end

    it "returns hello world" do
      expect(last_response.body).to eq "Hello World"
    end
  end
end
```


Let's update that file and write some basic tests to make sure that everything is working as expected. Replace the specs in the file with the following code:


```ruby
# spec/app/controller/page_controller_spec.rb

require 'spec_helper'

RSpec.describe "/page" do
  describe "GET #about" do

    it "renders the :about view" do
      get '/about'
      expect(last_response).to be_ok
    end
  end

  describe "GET #contact" do
    it "renders the :contact view" do
      get '/contact'
      expect(last_response).to be_ok
    end
  end

  describe "GET #home" do
    it "renders :home view" do
      get '/'
      expect(last_response).to be_ok
    end
  end
end
```


Let's explain the new things:


- `spec_helper` - Is a file to load commonly used functions to setup the tests.
- `describe block` - This block describes the context for our tests. Think of it as way to group related tests.
- `get ...` - This command executes a HTTP GET to the provided address.
- `last_response` - The response object returns the header and body of the HTTP request.


Now let's run the tests with `padrino rake rspec` and see what's going on:


```sh
...

Finished in 0.21769 seconds
3 examples, 0 failures
```


Cool, all tests passed! Please note that we run all tests with the command above. If you want to run only a specific
test you can use the following `rspec <path-to-spec>`. To run the `page_controller_spec` you have to use
`rspec spec/app/controllers/page_controller_spec.rb`.


We didn't exactly use behavior-driven development until now[^rspec-note].

[^rspec-note]: Note: It's possible your tests did not pass due to a Padrino error in which a comma ( , ) was omitted during the initial app generation that looks something like 'NameError: undefined local variable' check your `spec_helper.rb` file and make sure the following matches: `def app(app = nil, &blk)`, please  note the comma right after nil.


\begin{aside}
\heading{Red-Green Cycle}
\label{box:red-green-cycle}

In behavior-driven development (BDD) it is important to write a failing test first and then the code that satisfies the test. The red-green cycle represents the colors that you will see when executing these test: Red first, and then beautiful green. But once your code passes the tests, take yet a little more time to refactor your code. This little mind shift helps you a lot to think more about the problem and how to solve it. The test suite is a nice by product too.

\end{aside}
