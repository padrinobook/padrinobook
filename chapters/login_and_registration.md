## Login and Registration

In traditional frameworks you would generate a user with a `user` model and a `users_controller` with the
`new`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` actions. Besides you can't forget about security these days though would need to find a method of safely storing the password as well as validate our freshly registered users.


You don't have to reinvent the wheel you can use Padrino's beautiful [Admin interface](http://padrinorb.com/guides/features/padrino-admin/ "Padrino admin") for your user authentication[^vendor-authentication]. For educational reasons we are going to create our own authentication process consisting of the following parts:

- creating users
- creating views and routes
- sending confirmation emails
- encrypt passwords
- session management

[^vendor-authentication]: You could also use the [devise gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise "devise gem") as a flexible authentication solution, which gives you all the controller, migration and user properties. But using this does not keep your app clean because "*there will be no cruft and you will know how everything fits together*" as [Ryan Bigg](http://ryanbigg.com/ "Ryan Bigg") says in his book [Multitenacy with Rails - 2nd edition](https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2 "Multitenacy with Rails - 2nd edition").


### Extending the User Model

Before we are going to build the controller and the sign-up form for our application we need to specify the data each user has.


```sh
Name: String
Email: String
Password: String
```


Recording from chapter ~\ref{sec:user_model} we only need to add the `Password` fields to the user table:


Let's create the migration:


```sh
$ padrino-gen migration AddRegistrationFieldsToUsers
  apply  orms/activerecord
  create  db/migrate/004_add_registration_fields_to_users.rb
```


And write the fields into the migration:


```ruby
# db/migrate/004_add_registration_fields_to_users.rb

class AddRegistrationFieldsToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[4.2]
  @fields = [:password]

  def self.up
    change_table :users do |t|
      @fields.each { |field| t.string field}
    end
  end

  def self.down
    change_table :users do |t|
      @fields.each { |field| remove_column field}
    end
  end
end
```


Run the migrations.


### Validating attributes

Before we are going to implement the user registration relevant things we are going to write **pending**[^pending] specs for outlining
our tests:


```ruby
# spec/app/models/user_spec.rb

require 'spec_helper'

RSpec.describe User do
  ...

  pending('has no blank name')
  pending('has no blank email')

  describe "when name is already used" do
    pending('should not be saved')
  end

  describe "email address" do
    pending('valid')
    pending('not valid')
  end

  describe "passwords" do
    pending('no blank password')
    pending('no blank password_confirmation')
  end
end
```


[^pending]:The *pending* word is optional. It is enough to write pending tests only in the form `it "test this"` and leaving the do/end block away.


Before writing code to pass these specs, we need to add the `password` field to our factory:


```ruby
# spec/factories.rb

# encoding: utf-8
FactoryBot.define do
...
  factory :user do
    name  'wikimatze'
    email 'matthias@padrinobook.com'
    password "octocat"
  end
end
```


#### Presence Validation of Names

Let's implement the first pending test that a user can't have an empty name:


```ruby
# spec/app/models/user_spec.rb
...

it 'has no blank name' do
  user.name = ""
  expect(user.valid?).to be_falsey
end
...
```


If we run the test, we get the following error:


```sh
$ rspec spec

Failures:

  1) User Model has no blank name
     Failure/Error: expect(user.valid?).to be_falsey
       expected: falsey value
            got: true
     # ./spec/app/models/user_spec.rb:20:in `block (2 levels)
     # in <top (required)>'
     ...
```


To make this test pass we need to validate the `name` property in our user model with the help of the
[presence validation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#presence "presence validation"):


```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, presence: true
  ...
end
```


As a homework, please write the validates for the `email address` and `passwords` part of the specs on your own[^login-homework].


[^login-homework]: Please consider that the `password_confirmation` attribute can be create with the `:confirmation => true` option to the validates `:password` setting.


#### Uniqueness Validation of Names

We make sure that names in our application are unique. For testing we need create a second user with another mail address in our factory.
We need need to extend or factory with the [sequence function](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#sequences "sequence function factory girl"):


```ruby
# spec/factories

FactoryBot.define do
  sequence(:email){ |email_number| "matthias#{email_number}@padrinobook.com"}

  factory :user do
    name  'wikimatze'
    email
    password 'foo'
  end
  ...
end
```


Whenever you build a new `user` fixture, the value `email_number` is incremented and gives you a fresh user with a unique email address.
A test for this can be written in the following way:


```ruby
# spec/app/models/user_spec.rb

RSpec.describe User do
  let(:user) { build(:user) }
  let(:user_second) { build(:user) }
  ...

  describe "name is already used" do
    it 'should not be saved' do
      User.destroy_all
      user.save
      user_second.name = user.name
      user_second.save
      expect(user_second.valid?).to be_falsey
    end
  end
end
```


To make the test green you have to use the [uniqueness validation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#uniqueness "uniqueness validation") (Note that we use the [destroy_all](http://www.rubydoc.info/docs/rails/4.1.7/ActiveRecord%2FAssociations%2FCollectionProxy%3Adestroy_all "destroy_all") to destroy all users in the database and there associations). All what it does is to validates that the attribute's value is unique before it gets saved.


```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, :email, :password, presence: true
  validates :name, uniqueness: true

  has_many :job_offers
end
```


#### Format Validation

Next we are going to implement the validation for the email field. Here are the specs


```ruby
# spec/app/models/user_spec.rb
...
describe "email address" do
  it 'valid' do
    adresses = %w[thor@marvel.de hero@movie.com]
    adresses.each do |email|
      user.email = email
      user_second.email = email
      expect(user_second.valid?).to be_truthy
    end
  end

  it 'not valid' do
    adresses = %w[spamspamspam.de heman,test.com]
    adresses.each do |email|
      user_second.email = email
      expect(user_second.valid?).to be_falsey
    end
  end
end
```


We can test the correctness of the `email` field with a regular expression. First we are going to define a regular expression and use the [format validation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#format "format validation") which will apply our regular expression against which the field will be tested.


```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  ...
  VALID_EMAIL_REGEX = /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i
  validates :email, format: { with: VALID_EMAIL_REGEX }
  ...
end
```


\begin{aside}
\heading{Regular Expressions}
\label{box:regular-expressions}

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expressions") are your first tool when you need to match certain parts (or whole) strings against a predefined pattern. The drawback of using them is that you have to learn a formal language to define your patterns. I can highly recommend you the [Rubular tool](http://rubular.com "Rubular tool") for learning, training, and trying out the expression you want to use.

\end{aside}


### Users Controller

Since we already have our data-model for new potential users of our platform, it's time to make it accessible for our users with a users controller for signing up.


```sh
$ padrino-gen controller Users get:new
  create  app/controllers/users.rb
  create  app/helpers/users_helper.rb
  create  app/views/users
   apply  tests/rspec
  create  spec/app/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb
```


The new thing about the controller generation command is the `get:new` option. This will create an URL route `:new` to `users/new`.


\begin{aside}
\heading{Seven actions of a controller}
\label{box:seven-actions-of-a-controller}

In web application most controllers offers seven features to manage records:

- `new`: display an empty form
- `create`: save a record of a new item
- `index`: display a list of all items
- `show`: display a record of one item
- `edit`: display a record for editing
- `update`: save an edited record
- `destroy` â€“ delete a record

\end{aside}



#### Sign Up Action For Registration

We need to make sure to render the `users/new.erb` and user the `user` object route:


```ruby
# app/controllers/users.rb

JobVacancy::App.controllers :users do
  get :new, :map => "/register" do
    @user = User.new
    render 'new'
  end
end
```


#### Sign Up Form

The stage is set: We have the model with the tested constraints, and the controller for the user which handles the action. Time to create a sign up form.
For this case we can use the [form_for](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework/Padrino/Helpers/FormHelpers#form_for-instance_method "form_for") helper. This method takes an object (normally a model) as an input and creates a form using the attributes of the given object. Create a new erb file under the users view:


```erb
<%# app/views/users/new.erb %>

<h1>Registration</h1>

<% form_for(@user, '/users/create') do |f| %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :name, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.text_field :name, :class => 'input' %>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :email, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.text_field :email, :class => 'input' %>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :password, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.password_field :password %>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :password_confirmation, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.password_field :password_confirmation %>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.submit "Create", :class => "button is-large is-link" %>
    </div>
  </div>
<% end %>
```


- `form_for`: Is part of [Padrino's Form Builders](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/application-helpers#formbuilders "Padrino's Form Builders") and allows you to create standard input fields based on a model. The first argument to the function is an object (normally a model), the second argument is an string (the action to which the form should be sent after a submit), and the third parameter are settings in form of a hash.
- `f.label` and `f.text`: A label and a text field for the attributes of your model.
- `f.password_field`: Constructs a password input element.
- `f.submit`: Takes a string as a caption for the submit button and options as hashes for additional parameter (for `example :class => 'label'`).


The form will be rendered in the following HTML:


```html
<form action="/users/create" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">\
  <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token"\
    value="7JCJxXEWCaP9aFTZhOqD9a/Ff8ot47U+Xo/ENR3zsXc=" />
  <div class="field">
    <label for="user_name" class="label">Name: </label>
    <div class="control">
      <input type="text" name="user[name]" id="user_name"class="input" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <label for="user_email" class="label">Email: </label>
    <div class="control">
      <input type="text" name="user[email]" id="user_email" class="input" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <label for="user_password" class="label">Password: </label>
    <div class="control">
      <input type="password" name="user[password]" id="user_password"\
        class="input" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <label for="user_password_confirmation"\
      class="label">Password confirmation: </label>
    <div class="control">
      <input type="password" name="user[password_confirmation]"\
        id="user_password_confirmation" />
    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <div class="control">
      <input type="submit" value="Create" class="button is-large is-link" />
    </div>
  </div>
</form>
```


#### Sign Up Form Save Data


Until now we are not saving the inputs of the user. Let's code the `create` action which saves the new registered:


```ruby
# app/controllers/users.rb

JobVacancy::App.controllers :users do
  ...
  post :create do
    @user = User.new(params[:user])
    @user.save
    redirect('/')
  end
  ...
end
```


Let's go through the new parts:


- `User.new(params[:users])`: Will create a new user object based on the information of the form attributes of the `user` model which which were part of the form from the `views/users/new.erb page`.
- `@user.save`: Will persists the user in the database.
- `redirect`: Will redirect the user to the root directory of our app.


\begin{aside}
\heading{What are instance variables and why use them in controllers?}
\label{box:what-are-instance-variables}

Instance variables are bound to an instance of class and defines the state of an object. Through this every instance of
a class has the same name for the instance variables but each of them has different values different.

By using `@user` in the controller, we can use this instance in our [form_for](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework/Padrino/Helpers/FormHelpers#form_for-instance_method "form_for") helper as an object to fill all the
necessary information for a user. So every user share the same features with different values.
\end{aside}


What about the mistakes a user makes during his input? How can we display any mistakes a user is making and preserve the things he already typed in?

If you send the form without any inputs, you will see that you are redirected into the root of your app. You can't figure out what's wrong, but luckily we have logs:


```sh
DEBUG -  (0.1ms)  begin transaction
DEBUG - User Exists (0.3ms)  SELECT 1 AS one FROM "users" WHERE
  "users"."name" = '' LIMIT 1
DEBUG - User Exists (0.2ms)  SELECT 1 AS one FROM "users" WHERE
  "users"."email" = '' LIMIT 1
DEBUG -  (0.2ms)  rollback transaction
DEBUG -     POST (0.0162ms) /users/create - 303 See Other
DEBUG - TEMPLATE (0.0004ms) /page/home
DEBUG - TEMPLATE (0.0002ms) /application

DEBUG -      GET (0.0017ms) /favicon.ico - 404 Not Found
```


The `rollback transaction` was triggered because the validation of our user model had been violated. Try to create an `User.new` model in the console and call the `.errors` method on:


```ruby
>> user = User.new
=> #<User id: nil, name: nil, email: nil, created_at: nil, password: nil>
>> user.save
  DEBUG -   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  DEBUG -  User Exists (0.1ms)  SELECT 1 AS one FROM "users"
    WHERE "users"."name" IS NULL LIMIT 1
  DEBUG -  User Exists (0.1ms)  SELECT 1 AS one FROM "users"
    WHERE "users"."email" IS NULL LIMIT 1
  DEBUG -   (0.0ms)  rollback transaction
=> false
>> user.errors
=> #<ActiveModel::Errors:0x9dea518 @base=#<User id: nil, name: nil, email: nil,
   #created_at: nil,
    updated_at: nil, password: nil>, messages{:name=>["can't be blank"],
    :password=>["is too short (minimum is 5 characters)", "can't be blank"],
    :email=>["can't be blank", "is invalid"]}
```


We can use this information to display the errors in our form for user feedback. In a first try, we use [error\_messages\_for](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework/Padrino%2FHelpers%2FFormHelpers%2FErrors:error_messages_for "error messages for method") method:


```erb
<%# app/views/users/new.erb %>

<% form_for(@user, '/users/create') do |f| %>
  ...
  <%= error_messages_for @user %>
  ...
<% end %>
```


It counts the number of errors `@user.errors.count` and is looping through all field with their error messages like the following:


```text
5 errors prohibited this User from being saved
There were problems with the following fields:

Name can't be blank
Password is too short (minimum is 5 characters)
Password can't be blank
Email can't be blank
Email is invalid
```


This isn't something we want to ship to our customers. Let's change this by using [error\_message\_on](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework/Padrino%2FHelpers%2FFormHelpers%2FErrors:error_message_on  "error message on method") which returns a string containing the error message attached to the method on the object:[^error_message_on]


```erb
<%# app/views/users/new.erb %>

<% form_for(@user, '/users/create') do |f| %>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :name, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.text_field :name, :class => 'input' %>
    </div>
    <%= error_message_on :user, :name %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :email, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.text_field :email, :class => 'input' %>
    </div>
    <%= error_message_on :user, :email %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :password, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.password_field :password %>
    </div>
    <%= error_message_on :user, :password %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :password_confirmation, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.password_field :password_confirmation %>
    </div>
    <%= error_message_on :user, :password_confirmation %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.submit "Create", :class => "button is-large is-link" %>
    </div>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

[^error_message_on]: Instead of writing `@user` for the `error_message_on` you can also use the symbol notation `:user`.


Let's add the `:class` at the of the `error_message_on` method with the help of the [has-background-danger class from bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/modifiers/color-helpers/#background-color "has-background-danger class from bulma") and using the `:prepend` option which add text to before displaying the field error:


```erb
<%# views/users/new.erb %>

<% form_for(@user, '/users/create') do |f| %>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :name, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.text_field :name, :class => 'input' %>
    </div>
    <%= error_message_on :user, :name, :class => "has-background-danger",\
      :prepend => "The name" %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :email, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.text_field :email, :class => 'input' %>
    </div>
    <%= error_message_on :user, :email, :class => "has-background-danger",\
      :prepend => "The email" %>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :password, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.password_field :password %>
    </div>
    <%= error_message_on :user, :password, :class => "has-background-danger",\
      :prepend => "The password"%>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :password_confirmation, :class => 'label' %>
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.password_field :password_confirmation %>
    </div>
    <%= error_message_on :user, :password_confirmation,\
      :class => "has-background-danger",\
      :prepend => "The password confirmation"%>
  </div>

  <div class="field">
    <div class="control">
      <%= f.submit "Create", :class => "button is-large is-link" %>
    </div>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

If you fill out the form with complete valid parameters and watch your log again:


```sh
DEBUG -  (0.2ms)  begin transaction
DEBUG - User Exists (0.3ms)  SELECT 1 AS one FROM "users" WHERE
  "users"."name" = 'Testuser' LIMIT 1

Remember to have an eye into your logs to detect possible back-end problems.



\begin{aside}
\heading{What are VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?) in a SQL insert query?}
\label{box:parameterized-query}

These form of inserting data in your database is known as parameterized queries. A parameterized query is a query in which placeholders are used for parameters and the parameter values are supplied at execution time. The most important reason to use parameterized queries is to avoid [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection "SQL injection") attacks. SQL injection means that SQL statements are injected into input fields in order to get access/delete user data.
\end{aside}


### Emails

Padrino uses the [Padrino Mailer gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/padrino-mailer "Padrino Mailer gem") for sending mails. For simplification, we are using SMTP with Gmail. First we need to place our setting for emails in in `app.rb`[^app-rb]:


```ruby
# app/app.rb

module JobVacancy
  class App < Padrino::Application
    ...
    set :delivery_method, smtp: {
      address: 'smtp.gmail.com',
      port: 587,
      user_name: '<your-gmail-account-address>',
      password: '<secret>',
      authentication: :plain
    }
    ...
  end
end
```

[^app-rb]: The main configuration file of our application.

Let's get through all the different options:


- `delivery_method`: Defines the delivery method. Possible values are [:smtp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol") (default), [:sendmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail "Sendmail"), `:test` (no mails will be send), and [:file](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-configuration "Action Mailer configuration") (will write the contents of the email in a file).
- `address`: The SMTP mail address.
- `port`: The port of the mail address.
- `user_name`: The name of the SMTP address.
- `password`: The password of your SMTP address.
- `authentication`: Specify if your mail server requires authentication. The default setting is plain meaning that the password is not encrypted.

You can also pass use `domain` for emails which sets up for [HELO
checking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques#Strict_enforcement_of_RFC_standards "HELO checking").

Prior to Padrino *0.10.7* the `enable_starttls_auto` option was changeable. This option is now always enabled. The [starttls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS "starttls") is a mechanism for encrypted communication with the Transport Layer Security.


We won't test the email functionality to this point because the *Mailer gem* is already tested.


#### Quick Mail Usage

To send a first simple 'Hello' message we create an [email block](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/blob/master/padrino-mailer/lib/padrino-mailer/base.rb#L26 "email block") directly in our user controller:


```ruby
# app/controllers/users.rb

JobVacancy::App.controllers :users do
  ...
  post :create do
    @user = User.new(params[:user])
    if @user.save
      email do
        from 'admin@job-vacancy.de'
        to 'lordmatze@gmail.com'
        subject 'Welcome!'
        body 'Hello'
      end
      redirect('/')
    else
      render 'new'
    end
  end
end
```


Now start the app, go to the URL <http://localhost:3000/login>, and register a fresh user. You can check the log if the mail was send or you "feel" a slow down in your application because it takes a while before the mail is send:

#### Mailer

We could go on and parametrized our email example above, but this would mean that we have email code directly into our controller code. We can do better by wrapping up the logic into an object and let it handle the action.


With the help of [mailer](http://www.padrinorb.com/api/Padrino/Mailer.html "Padrino mailer") we can create customized:


```sh
$ padrino-gen mailer Registration registration_email
  create  app/mailers/registration.rb
  create  app/views/mailers/registration
```


Let's break it down:


- `mailer`: The command to create a custom mailer. Inside a mailer you can define the name of your mailer object and it's different templates. The name of our first email is `registration_email`.
- `Registration`: Name of the mailer.


Now we let's look into the `registration.rb` file:


```ruby
# app/mailers/registration.rb

JobVacancy:App.mailer :registration do
  email :registration_email do
    # Your mailer goes here
  end
end
```

Let's fill the the registration with our code from the `users`controller:


```ruby
# app/mailers/registration.rb

JobVacancy::App.mailer :registration do
  email :registration_email do
    from 'admin@job-vacancy.de'
    to 'lordmatze@gmail.com'
    subject 'Welcome!'
    body 'Hello'
  end
end
```


Now we can use the `deliver` method to call our `:registration` mailer with it's `:registration_email` template:


```ruby
# app/controller/users.rb

...
post :create do
  @user = User.new(params[:user])
  if @user.save
    deliver(:registration, :registration_email)
    redirect('/')
  else
    render 'new'
  end
end
...
```


\begin{aside}
\heading{Difference between Padrino's Mailer methods email and deliver}
\label{box:difference-between-mailer-and-deliver}

The [email](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework/Padrino%2FMailer%2FHelpers%2FClassMethods:email "email helper method") method has the parameters `mail_attributes = {}, &block`. That means the you write emails directly `JobVacancy.email(to: '...', from: '...', subject: '...', body:  '...')` or use the block syntax `JobVacancy.email do ... end`. The [deliver](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework/Padrino%2FMailer%2FHelpers%2FClassMethods:deliver "deliver helper method") method has `mailer_name, message_name, *attributes` as attributes. In order to use this you always to create a Mailer for them.

If you want to use very simple mails in your application, prefer to use the `email` method. But if you have templates with a much more complex layout in different formats (plain, HTML), the `deliver` method is the best fit.

\end{aside}


Instead of writing only a simple 'Hello' in our email we would like to give more input. First we need to write an template and then use the `render` method in our registration mailer. Let's define the registration template:


```erb
<%# app/views/mailers/registration/registration_email.plain.erb %>

Hi <%= name %>,

we are glad to have you on our platform. Feel free to post jobs and find the
right people for your application.

Your Job Vacancy!
```


Now we need to make sure that we are rendering the `registration_email` template our registration mailer:


```ruby
# app/mailers/registration.rb

JobVacancy::App.mailer :registration do
  email :registration_email do
    from 'admin@job-vacancy.de'
    to 'lordmatze@gmail.com'
    subject 'Welcome!'
    render 'registration/registration_email'
    content_type :plain # is the default, :html is also possible
```


If you are sure that you only want to send plain text mail, you can leave the `plain` extension away but making it explicit makes it clear for everyone.


To personalize our mail we want mention the name of the fresh registered in the registration email as well as sent it to their given mail. First we need to pass the `name` and `email` to our mail block and pass the name to the template via the `locals` option:


```ruby
# app/mailers/registration.rb

JobVacancy::App.mailer :registration do
  email :registration_email do |name, email|
    from 'admin@job-vacancy.de'
    to email
    subject 'Welcome!'
    locals :name => name
    render 'registration/registration_email'
    content_type :plain
  end
end
```


The `locals` options provides us a hash in the email template. All we need now it to pass the `name` and the `email` to our `deliver` method:


```ruby
# app/controllers/users.rb
...

post :create do
  @user = User.new(params[:user])

  if @user && @user.valid?
    @user.save

    deliver(:registration, :registration_email, @user.name, @user.email)
    redirect('/')
  else
    render 'new'
  end
end
```


Now we want to add a PDF which explains the main business needs to our page. For this purpose we will save the `welcome.pdf` into the `public/pdfs` folder.

To attach assets (images, PDF, video) into our mail we can make use of the [add_file](https://github.com/mikel/mail/blob/master/lib/mail/message.rb#L1755 "add_file method of the mailer gem") method. It takes a filename and the content as hash elements as arguments.


```ruby
# app/mailers/registration.rb
...

WELCOME_PDF = "#{Padrino.root}/public/pdfs/welcome.pdf".freeze

email :registration_email do |name, email|
  from 'admin@job-vacancy.de'
  subject 'Welcome!'
  to email
  locals name: name, email: email
  render 'registration/registration_email'
  add_file filename: 'welcome.pdf', content: File.read(WELCOME_PDF)
end
```


If the mail will be send you can see something like this in your logs:


```text

# Four pages of encoded MIME message attachment ...
```


\begin{aside}
\heading{MIME?}
\label{box:mime}

MIME stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions" and they specify additional attributes to email headers like the content type and defines transfer encodings which can be used to present a higher encoded file (e.g. 8-bit) with the 7-bit ASCII character set. This makes it possible to put non-English characters in the message header.

The goal of the MIME definition was that existing email servers had nothing to change in order to use MIME types. This means that MIME headers are optional for plain text emails and even none MIME messages can be read correctly by a clients being able to read MIME encoded messages.

\end{aside}


### Sending Email with Confirmation Link

The basic steps for implementing the logic of email confirmation are the following:


- Add the `confirmation_token` and `confirmation` attributes in our user model.
- Create a controller method for our user model that expects a user id and `confirmation_token`, looks up the user, checks if the submitted `confirmation_token` exists in our database, and clears the code after confirmation so that it is valid only one time.
- Add a route that maps to our new controller method (e.g. `/confirm/<user-id>/<code>`).
- Create a mailer template which takes the user as a parameter and use the *confirmation code* of the user to send a mail containing a link to the new confirmation route.
- Protect our controller methods and views to prevent security issues with a helper method to check if the current user
  is confirmed.


\begin{aside}
\heading{Why Confirmation Mail?}
\label{box:why-confirmation-mail}

Check that the user actually signed up for the account and actually wants it. This also helps you from spamming your platform with unwanted users. Another usage of this information is to give your users a chance to change their password and/or stay in contact with them to inform them about updates.

\end{aside}


#### Add Confirmation Code and Confirmation Attributes to the User Model

Create a migration and add the fields to the file:


```sh
$ padrino-gen migration AddConfirmationTokenAndConfirmationToUsers
    confirmation_token:string confirmation:boolean
   apply  orms/activerecord
  create  db/migrate/005_add_confirmation_token_and_confirmation_to_users.rb
```


```ruby
# db/migrate/005_add_confirmation_token_and_confirmation_to_users.rb

class AddConfirmationCodeAndConfirmationToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[4.2]
  def self.up
    change_table :users do |t|
      t.string :confirmation_token
      t.boolean :confirmation, default: false
    end
  end

  def self.down
    change_table :users do |t|
      t.remove_column :confirmation_token, :confirmation
    end
  end
end
```


We added the `:default` option which sets the confirmation for every user to false if a new one is registered. Now let's migrate our production and test database to this new event:


```sh
$ padrino rake ar:migrate
$ padrino rake ar:migrate -e test
```


### My Tests are Slow ... use Mocks!

During writing this book I discovered various strange behavior for my tests because I was writing data into my test database. The tests weren't really reliable because some worked only when the database is fresh with no preexisting entries. One solution would be to clean up the database before each run:


```sh
$ sqlite3 db/job_vacancy_test.db
  SQLite version 3.7.13 2012-06-11 02:05:22
  Enter ".help" for instructions
  Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
  sqlite> DELETE FROM users;
  sqlite> .quit
```


But after this my tests were running very slow:


```sh
$ rspec spec
...

Finished in 1.61 seconds
25 examples, 0 failures
```


Running them again make them a little bit faster:


```sh
$ rspec spec
...

Finished in 0.77209 seconds
25 examples, 0 failures
```


Why? Because we are hitting the database. Consider the following method which will be part of the following chapter as an example:


```ruby
def encrypt_confirmation_token
  salt = BCrypt::Engine.generate_salt
  token = BCrypt::Engine.hash_secret(user.password, salt)
  user.confirmation_token = token
end
```


We need to use **mocks** to simulate the generating of password hashes to stable values, otherwise our test would be very brittle because the value changes during every execution. The benefits of mocks are that you create the environment you want to test and don't care about all the preconditions to make this test possible.


The magic behind mocking is to use the [receive](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks#message-expectations "receive expectation from RSpec") and [return](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks#consecutive-return-values "return expectation from RSpec") expectation flow. `Receive` says which method should be called and `and_return` what should be returned when the specified method is called.


A test for the `encrypt_confirmation_token` method may look like:


```ruby
let(:user) { build(:user) }

it 'encrypts the confirmation token of the user' do
  salt = '$2a$10$y0Stx1HaYV.sZHuxYLb25.'
  expected_confirmation_token =
    '$2a$10$y0Stx1HaYV.sZHuxYLb25.zAi0tu1C5N.oKMoPT6NbjtD.3cg7Au'
  expect(BCrypt::Engine).to receive(:generate_salt).and_return(salt)
  expect(BCrypt::Engine).to receive(:hash_secret)
    .with(user.password, salt)
    .and_return(expected_confirmation_token)

  expect(user.confirmation_token)
    .to eq expected_confirmation_token
end
```


With the help of mocks you keep your tests fast and robust. Even if this will be the first application you write, when you've learned something new
and this will make your life easier, go back and take your time to enhance the style and design of your application.


### Controller Method and Action For Password Confirmation
\label{sec:controller_method_and_action_for_password_confirmation}

When we are going to register a new user, we need to create a confirmation code. Since this is business logic, we will put this method inside
our users model. First we will write a failing test:


```ruby
# spec/app/models/user_spec.rb
...
  it 'has confirmation token' do
    user.confirmation_token = ''
    expect(user.valid?).to be_falsey

    user.confirmation_token = '1'
    expect(user.valid?).to be_truthy
  end
...
```


To make this test pass we add the validates presence of ability in our user model:


```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  ...
  validates :confirmation_token, presence: true
  ...
end
```


Next we need think of how we can set the `confirmation_token` information to our freshly created user. Instead of creating a confirmation code on our own, we want to encrypt the password by some mechanism. Luckily, we can use [bcrypt](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby "bcrypt gem") to create our confirmation code. It is a Ruby binding for the [OpenBSD bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD_security_features "OpenBSD bcrypt") password hashing algorithm. In order to use this in our app we need to add it to our `Gemfile`:


```ruby
# Gemfile
...

# Security
gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.11'

```


Now let's open the console and play around with this Gem:


```sh
$ padrino c
  ...
  >> password = "Test123"
  => "Test123"
  >> salt = "$2a$05$CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC.E5YPO9kmyuRGyh0XouQYb4YMJKvyOeW"
  => "$2a$05$CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC.E5YPO9kmyuRGyh0XouQYb4YMJKvyOeW"
  >> BCrypt::Engine.hash_secret(password, salt)
  => "$2a$05$CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC.R0E8oIJQ4Okva8QVfxJ3FY3GZ7x/O.6"
```


\begin{aside}
\heading{What is a Salt?}
\label{box:what-is-a-salt}

Salts are used in cryptography as random data to be put as addition to normal password to create an encrypted hash with the help of a **one-way function**. A one-way function output by some input string very easily but the other way round is very difficult for the computer to compute the original string from the output.

Salts make it more difficult for hackers to get the password via **rainbow tables** attacks. Rainbow tables are a huge list of precomputed hashes for widely used password. If a hacker gets access to a password hash he then compare this hash with the entries. If he finds after which he was searching he got the password for the user.

\end{aside}


We could add these methods in the users controller but that isn't something a controller should do. We better use a [callback](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html#callbacks-overview "callbacks for ActiveRecord validations"). **Callbacks** are methods to run on a certain stage or life cycle of an object. Let's make use of it in our `user` model:


```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

require 'bcrypt'

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  ... # The other validations

  before_save :encrypt_confirmation_token,
    :if => :registered? # our callback with if condition

  private
  def encrypt_confirmation_token
    self.confirmation_token = set_confirmation_token
  end

  def set_confirmation_token
    salt = BCrypt::Engine.generate_salt
    token = BCrypt::Engine.hash_secret(self.password, salt)
    normalize_confirmation_token(token)
  end

  def normalize_confirmation_token(token)
    token.delete('/').delete('+')
  end

  def registered?
    self.new_record?
  end
end
```


We won't test the methods under the private[^why-private-callbacks] keyword, there is no customized business logic inside these methods and we
are just using third party libraries which are tested.


[^why-private-callbacks]: It is good practice to make your callbacks private that they can called *only from inside the model*. Our `confirmation_token` method is public available but that is no problem, because it generates a random string.


After creating the confirmation code mechanism for our user, we need to implement an authentication which takes the confirmation code as an input and mark our user as *confirmed*. Let's start with failing tests:


```ruby
# spec/app/models/user_spec.rb
...

describe '#authenticate' do
  let(:user) { build(:user) }

  it 'authenticates user with correct confirmation' do
    expect(User).to receive(:find_by_id)
      .with(user.id)
      .and_return(user)
    expect(user.authenticate(user.confirmation_token)).to be_truthy
  end

  it 'reject user with incorrect confirmation code' do
    expect(user.authenticate('wrong')).to be_falsey
  end
end
```


\begin{aside}
\heading{Take care of your names!?}
\label{box:take-care-of-names}


During writing this chapter I lost a couple of hours because I had method with the same name as the `confirmation_token` field. When I wanted to check `@user.confirmation_token` it always called the `confirmation_token` method which return a new confirmation code. I was thinking for a long time that it returned the attribute and was wondering what's going on. A couple of [pry](http://pryrepl.org "pry") sessions showed me nothing since my expectation was.

After I went to the toilet I started another pry session and out of sudden I discovered my naming problem. Lesson learned: Breaks are great!

\end{aside}


Before going on we need to update our `factory` for the test with the confirmation code field::


```ruby
# spec/factories.rb

# encoding: utf-8

FactoryBot.define do
  ...
  sequence(:confirmation_token) { '1' }
  sequence(:id) { |n| n }

  factory :user do
    id
    name
    email
    password "octocat"
    confirmation_token
  end
  ...
end
```


The value for the `confirmation_token` will always be 1 which makes our tests easier. Here is the code that makes our tests green:


```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  ...

  def authenticate(token)
    @user = User.find_by_id(self.id)

    if @user && @user.confirmation_token == token
      self.confirmation = true
      self.save
      return true
    end

    false
  end
  ...
end
```


Since our tests of our user model are now green, let's write tests for our `/confirm` route:


```ruby
# spec/app/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb

describe "GET confirm" do
  let(:user) { build(:user) }

  it "render the '/confirm' page if user has confirmation code" do
    user.save
    confirmed_user = User.find_by_id(user.id)
    get "/confirm/#{confirmed_user.id}/#{confirmed_user.confirmation_token}"
    expect(last_response).to be_ok
  end

  it 'redirect to :confirm if user id is wrong' do
    get "/confirm/test/#{user.confirmation_token}"
    expect(last_response).to be_redirect
    expect(last_response.body).to include("Confirmation token is wrong.")
  end

  it 'redirect to :confirm if confirmation id is wrong' do
    get "/confirm/#{user.id}/test"
    expect(last_response).to be_redirect
    expect(last_response.body).to include("Confirmation token is wrong.")
  end
end
```


To make this pass, we implement the following code:


```ruby
# app/controllers/users.rb
...

get :confirm, :map => "/confirm/:id/:code" do
    @user = User.find_by_id(params[:id])

    if @user && @user.authenticate(params[:code])
      flash.now[:notice] = "You have been confirmed. Please confirm with the mail
        we've send you recently."
      render 'confirm'
    else
      redirect '/', flash[:error] = 'Confirmation token is wrong.'
    end
end
```


Please note that we are using [flash.now](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework/Padrino/Flash/Storage#now-instance_method "flash.now") because in case of an success we stay at the confirm page without making a new request. Play around and use `flash` only, as a result you should see
the success message twice.


**Rule of the thumb**: To display the flash in render, use `flash.now[:error]` and to display the flash in redirect, use `flash[:error]`


### Mailer Template for Confirmation Email

We could be lazy by adding our confirmation email into the registration mailer. But they have nothing to-do with each
other so let's create a mailer for this purpose:


```sh
$ padrino-gen mailer Confirmation confirmation_email
  create  app/mailers/confirmation.rb
  create  app/views/mailers/confirmation
```


Now fill out the confirmation mailer:


```ruby
# app/mailers/confirmation.rb

JobVacancy::App.mailer :confirmation do
  CONFIRMATION_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/confirm'.freeze

  email :confirmation_email do |name, email, id, link|
    from 'admin@job-vacancy.de'
    subject 'Please confirm your account'
    to email
    locals name: name, confirmation_link:
      "#{CONFIRMATION_URL}/#{id}/#{link}"
    render 'configuration/confirmation_email'
  end
end
```


Fill the email template with "confirmation-link-life":


```erb
<%# app/views/mailers/confirmation/confirmation_email.plain.erb %>

Hi <%= name %>,

to take fully advantage of our platform you have to follow the following link:

<%= confirmation_link %>

Enjoy the possibility to find the right people for your jobs.
```


And call this `confirmation_email` in our users controller:


```ruby
# app/controllers/users.rb

post :create do
  @user = User.new(params[:user])

  if @user.save
    deliver(:registration, :registration_email, @user.name, @user.email)
    deliver(:confirmation, :confirmation_email, @user.name,
            @user.email,
            @user.id,
            @user.confirmation_token)
    redirect('/')
  else
    render 'new'
  end
end
```


### Registration and Confirmation Emails

The code is working but we have flaws in our design:


1. The controller is sending mails but this is not the responsibility of it.
2. Our user model is blown up with authentication code.


\begin{aside}
\heading{Observers vs. Callbacks vs. POROs}
\label{box:Observers-vs-callbacks-vs-poros}

[Observers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern "Observers")[^observers] are a design pattern where an object has a list of its dependents called observers, and notifies them automatically if its state has changed by calling one of their methods. Observers means to be decoupling responsibility. They can serve as a connection point between your models and some other functionality of another system.
Observers "lives" longer in your application and can be attached/detached at any time.

[Callbacks'](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html "Callbacks") live shorter - you pass it to a function to be called only once.

**\coloredtext{red}{Rule of the thumb}**: When you use callbacks with code that isn't directly related to your model, you better put this into an observer.


The observer pattern decouples event producers from event consumers but tightly couples models to them - and that make
it hard to test them because you always have them always around. Besides they add a kind of hidden magic to your code,
you may forget when you that they are always around you. Better way is to make those calls explicit in your controller.
That where **Plain Old Ruby Objects** ([PORO](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-09-06-the-secret-to-rails-oo-design "PORO"))
jump in. They make magic calls explicit, are easier to test, and reusable.


[^observers]: If you want to use them in your projects, I have written an article about observers in Padrino under [https://wikimatze.de/observers-in-padrino/](https://wikimatze.de/observers-in-padrino/ "https://wikimatze.de/observers-in-padrino/").
\end{aside}


We want to have a class which sends the registration and confirmation email. To see what we can move out of the user
model let's have a look inside this model:


```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

require 'bcrypt'

User < ActiveRecord::Base
  ...
  before_save :encrypt_confirmation_token, :if => :registered?

  private
  def encrypt_confirmation_token
    self.confirmation_token = set_confirmation_token
  end

  def set_confirmation_code
    salt = BCrypt::Engine.generate_salt
    token = BCrypt::Engine.hash_secret(self.password, salt)
    normalize_confirmation_token(token)
  end

  def registered?
    self.new_record?
  end

  def normalize_confirmation_token(token)
    token.delete('/').delete('+')
  end
end
```


And refactor the code above into the `UserCompletionMail` class:


```ruby
# lib/Infrastructure/Mail/user_completion_mail.rb

require 'bcrypt'

class UserCompletionMail

  attr_accessor :user, :app

  def initialize(user, app = JobVacancy::App)
    @user = user
    @app ||= app
  end

  def send_registration_mail
    @app.deliver(
      :registration,
      :registration_email,
      @user.name,
      @user.email
    )
  end

  def send_confirmation_mail
    @app.deliver(
      :confirmation,
      :confirmation_email,
      @user.name,
      @user.email,
      @user.id,
      @user.confirmation_token
    )
  end

  def encrypt_confirmation_token
    salt = BCrypt::Engine.generate_salt
    confirmation_code = BCrypt::Engine.hash_secret(@user.password, salt)
    @user.confirmation_token = normalize(confirmation_code)
  end

  private
  def normalize(token)
    token.gsub("/", "")
  end
end
```

Please note that I've added the `lib/Infrastructure/Mail` folder to have better order and separation of files.

We are not using the single `deliver` method here because our file does not have access to it. Instead we have
to take `JobVacancy::App.deliver` way to access the mail[^found-out]


[^found-out]: It is not documented as I [found out](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1770).


Here is the spec for the class:


```ruby
# spec/lib/Infrastucture/Mail/user_completion_mail_spec.rb

require 'spec_helper'

RSpec.describe UserCompletionMail do
  describe "user new record" do
    let(:user) { build(:user) }

    it 'sends registration mail' do
      expect(app).to receive(:deliver)
        .with(:registration, :registration_email, user.name, user.email)

      @user_completion_mail = UserCompletionMail.new(user, app)
      @user_completion_mail.send_registration_mail
    end

    it 'sends confirmation mail' do
      expect(app).to receive(:deliver)
        .with(:confirmation,
              :confirmation_email,
              user.name,
              user.email,
              user.id,
              user.confirmation_token
             )

      @user_completion_mail = UserCompletionMail.new(user, app)
      @user_completion_mail.send_confirmation_mail
    end

    it 'encrypts the confirmation token of the user' do
      salt = '$2a$10$y0Stx1HaYV.sZHuxYLb25.'
      expected_confirmation_code =
        '$2a$10$y0Stx1HaYV.sZHuxYLb25.zAi0tu1C5N.oKMoPT6NbjtD.3cg7Au'
      expect(BCrypt::Engine).to receive(:generate_salt).and_return(salt)
      expect(BCrypt::Engine).to receive(:hash_secret)
        .with(user.password, salt)
        .and_return(expected_confirmation_code)
      @user_completion_mail = UserCompletionMail.new(user, app(JobVacancy::App))
      @user_completion_mail.encrypt_confirmation_token

      expect(@user_completion_mail.user.confirmation_code)
        .to eq expected_confirmation_code
    end
  end
end
```


Instead of writing `app(JobVacancy::App)` to simulate  you can also pass `app` in the `UserCompletionMail.new` function.
The `app` variable is automatically defined in the `spec_helper`:


```ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
...

def app(app = nil, &blk)
  @app ||= block_given? ? app.instance_eval(&blk) : app
  @app ||= Padrino.application
end
```


I have mentioned in the beginning of the chapter that our `UserCompletionMail` class should sends the registration and
confirmation email[^srp-violation].  But actually is is also encrypts the confirmation token of the user which is not clear from it's name.


[^srp-violation]: According to SRP (see box ~\ref{box:srp}) sending registration and confirmation mails are a clear function of the class - the domain is registration. To have two methods in class serving the same domain is no violation against SRP.


\begin{aside}
\heading{Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)}
\label{box:srp}

[SRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle "SRP") says that every class or module should have a clear function over a
single piece of functionality offered by the software. This responsibility should be entirely encapsulated in the class

SRP is part of the [SOLID design principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) "SOLID design principles").

\end{aside}


Let'extract this logic in a new `UserTokenConfirmationEncryptionService` class:


```ruby
# lib/Service/user_token_confirmation_encryption_service.rb
require 'bcrypt'

class UserTokenConfirmationEncryptionService
  include JobVacancy::String::Normalizer

  attr_accessor :user

  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def encrypt_confirmation_token
    salt = BCrypt::Engine.generate_salt
    token = BCrypt::Engine.hash_secret(@user.password, salt)
    @user.confirmation_token = normalize(token)
  end
end
```


And the specs for it:


```ruby
# spec/lib/Service/user_token_confirmation_encryption_service_spec.rb
require 'spec_helper'

RSpec.describe UserTokenConfirmationEncryptionService do
  describe "#encrypt_confirmation_token" do
    let(:user) { build(:user) }

    it 'encrypts the confirmation token of the user' do
      salt = '$2a$10$y0Stx1HaYV.sZHuxYLb25.'
      expected_confirmation_token
        = '$2a$10$y0Stx1HaYV.sZHuxYLb25.zAi0tu1C5N.oKMoPT6NbjtD.3cg7Au'
      expect(BCrypt::Engine).to receive(:generate_salt).and_return(salt)
      expect(BCrypt::Engine).to receive(:hash_secret)
        .with(user.password, salt)
        .and_return(expected_confirmation_token)
      @service = UserTokenConfirmationEncryptionService.new(user)
      @service.encrypt_confirmation_token

      expect(@service.user.confirmation_token).to eq expected_confirmation_token
    end
  end
end
```


We need to remove the callback `before_save :encrypt_confirmation_token, :if => :registered?` and we need also to
transfer this logic into the controller:


```ruby
# app/controllers/users.rb

JobVacancy::App.controllers :users do
  ...
  post :create do
    @user = User.new(params[:user])

    if @user
      user_confirmation_encryption_service =
        UserTokenConfirmationEncryptionService.new(@user)
      user_confirmation_encryption_service.encrypt_confirmation_token

      if @user.valid?
        @user.save
        user_completion = UserCompletionMail.new(@user)
        user_completion.send_registration_mail
        user_completion.send_confirmation_mail
        redirect '/', flash[:notice] = "You have been registered.\
          Please confirm with the mail we've send you recently."
      else
        render 'new'
      end
    else
      render 'new'
    end
  end
end
```


Since we are using a redirect, `flash` method (see **Rule of the thumb** of section ~\ref{sec:controller_method_and_action_for_password_confirmation}) is the right choice.


And the tests for the controller:


```ruby
# spec/app/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb

require 'spec_helper'

RSpec.describe "/users" do
  ...
    describe "POST /users/create" do
    let(:user) { build(:user) }

    before do
      expect(User).to receive(:new).and_return(user)
    end

    context "user can be saved" do
      it 'redirects to home' do
        @completion_user_mail = double(UserCompletionMail)
        expect(UserCompletionMail).to receive(:new)
          .with(user)
          .and_return(@completion_user_mail)
        expect(@completion_user_mail).to receive(:send_registration_mail)
        expect(@completion_user_mail).to receive(:send_confirmation_mail)

        @user_token_encryption_service =
          double(UserTokenConfirmationEncryptionService)
        expect(UserTokenConfirmationEncryptionService).to receive(:new)
          .with(user)
          .and_return(@user_token_encryption_service)
        expect(@user_token_encryption_service)
          .to receive(:encrypt_confirmation_token)

        expect(user).to receive(:save).and_return(true)

        post "/users/create"
        expect(last_response).to be_redirect
        expect(last_response.body).to eq "You have been registered. " +
          "Please confirm with the mail we've send you recently."
      end
    end

    context "user cannot be saved" do
      it 'renders registration' do
        expect(user).to receive(:valid?)
          .and_return(false)
        expect(user).to_not receive(:save)
        post "/users/create"
        expect(last_response).to be_ok
        expect(last_response.body).to include 'Registration'
      end
    end
  end
end
```
